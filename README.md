# simple-CSharp-store

logic for a C# Unity game with in-game items and purchases via Facebook SDK

So basically what is happening here is a store populated via a small database, updating the UI accordingly with the users choice

So we have different sections for skins, potions, armors and one to purchase in-game currency (diamonds)

I decided to leave the API interacting with the Facebook's one out of this repository, for better reusability

## Features:

* displays currency
* displays current inventory and equipped items
* updates sections programmatically 
* populates itself with the Database class
